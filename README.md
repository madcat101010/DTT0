Description: Our game is based off of the game called "Don't Tap The White Tile". The game will display an array of four numbers, ordered 1-4. Three of the numbers are 0's and only one is 1. The goal of the game is to avoid pressing the key locations which contain a 0. Currently, there is only one mode called 'Classic mode' which waits for user input before advancing to the next line. 

Instructions: To compile the program, run the makefile first. The makefile will handle the compilation. Then run DTT0 by typing “./DTT0”. An example of a line is “0 1 0 0”. In this case you will want to push the '2' button on your keyboard since the 1 is in the second position. If you push any other key, the game will end and your score will be displayed.
