Description: Our game is based off of the game called "Don't Tap The White Tile". The game will display an array of four numbers, ordered 1-4. Three of the numbers are 0's and only one is 1. The goal of the game is to avoid pressing the key locations which contain a 0. There are currently three game modes to choose from.

Instructions: To compile the program, run the makefile first. The makefile will handle the compilation. Then run DTT0 by typing “./DTT0”. The game then displays a menu of game modes to select from. The first game mode is freerun, which will just keep going while recording your time and score until you tap a zero. The second gamemode, classic, gives you 10 seconds to go as far as possible. You will lose one point per zero tapped. The last game mode, relay, will give you 10 seconds to tap 15 ones which will reset the timer. You can keep going until you run out of time or tap a zero. An example of a line being printed while the game is running is: “0 1 0 0”. In this case you will want to push the '2' button on your keyboard since the 1 is in the second position. If you push any other key, the game will end or your score will decrease depending on the game mode.
