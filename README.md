Description: Our game is based off of the game called "Don't Tap The White Tile". The game will display an array of four numbers, ordered 1-4. Three of the numbers are 0's and only one is 1. The goal of the game is to avoid pressing the key locations which contain a 0. Currently, there is only one mod called 'Classic mode' which waits for user input before advancing to the next line. 

Instructions: To compile the program, run the makefile first. The makefile will handle the compilation.
